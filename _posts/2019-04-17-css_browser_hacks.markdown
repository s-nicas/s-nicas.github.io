Hi Friends! 

As I mentioned in a previous post, cross-browser testing is important what works in Chrome might look a mess in Safari. Further so, what works well in Safari 12.1 might not look that great in Safari 10.1. I came across this issue this week. 

Then I was left with a problem: How do I update CSS code and have it work across all browsers. Ideally, you can quickly find a solution that will fit them all. However, if you are stuck and you need a fast fix there are a number of ‘browser hacks’ which will apply your CSS code only in specific browsers. Note: this is just a hack and should be a temporary fix. 

If you are curious and want to play around with them because well ….it’s fun! I like using [Browser Hacks](http://)


Happy Coding!
