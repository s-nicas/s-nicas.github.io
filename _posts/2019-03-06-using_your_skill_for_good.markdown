As software developers we cannot take for granted the gift and power that we have. By nature we build stuff. Bonus points if we build something really cool. Karma points if we build something that helps the community we live in. 

For many years, I have wanted to work in a non-for-profit industry. I longed for the need to help people. In today’s world, to be bluntly honest, I can’t afford to live in the Bay Area and work for a non-for-profit in an entry level role. It’s a sad reality. 

So how can we use our skill for good? 

I came across the best solution: volunteering. I recently discovered Code For America. They describe themselves as 

We are a network of people making government work for the people, by the people, in the digital age. How do we get there? With government services that are simple, effective, and easy to use, working at scale to help all Americans, starting with the people who need them most.



How neat is this?! Code for America builds and creates applications that make government services more accessible for the people?

In case you are struggling to envision how they do this here are a couple of projects they have done. 

* Clear My Record - You can apply to clear multiple California convictions at once https://www.clearmyrecord.org/

* Or they also helped Erase 8,000 pot convictions. https://apnews.com/1aeb5fed9e8746d8b120049e908af06c


The power of technology is real. It can change peoples lives. It can give people a second chance. Or it can level the playing field so everyone is playing by the same rules. 

You may be thinking, okay, but we can’t all get jobs at Code For America. 

Let me introduce you to Code For America’s Brigade Network. 

We're a national alliance of community organizers, developers, and designers that are putting technology to work in service of our local communities. We believe that government can work, for the people, by the people, in the digital age, if we all help.


It is likely that a city near you has a brigade. https://brigade.codeforamerica.org/ It is a community of volunteers who develop and create applications that will help the community. Everything from adopting a drain, to improving public transportation or city planning, or making campaign finances transparent; the Brigades can do. These are all projects I have seen at Code For America’s Brigade. 

It has been an incredibly rewarding experience to get involved and know that I am using my skills to help my community. 

If your city doesn’t have a Brigade, I would encourage you to look for coding for good hackathons. Like Ruby for Good in Washington https://rubyforgood.org/

If you can’t find anything in your city - you have discovered a possible need. Talk to your employer, see if they would be willing to sponsor a hackathon. 

*code for america did not sponsor this post LOL*

I simply want to share ways you can use your skills to help your community. Send me a message if you have any questions. 

Happy coding!
