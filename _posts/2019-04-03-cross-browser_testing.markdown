Needless to say, testing an application is important. Testing is a concept most developers can agree on. We build unit test, end-to-end testing - we do walkthroughs, etc.

 Another area of testing I was recently introduced to is cross-browser testing. Cross-browser testing is testing your web application across multiple browsers to ensure it works and looks correctly across all of them. 

Examples of web browsers are: 

* Chrome
* Safari
* Firefox


Testing doesn’t end here though. If you want to ensure your application really works you need to try different versions of the above browsers. Your application might work great in the newest version of Safari but it might break in an older version of Safari. There are tools to help you test your application in different versions of browsers. I recently used BrowserStack which worked great. 

We aren’t done testing just yet! 

What happens to your application when the wifi/internet connection isn’t the best? You can test this too! 

Here are the instructions to slow down your internet connection in Chrome. 

* Right click on the page and select inspect
* Click network
* At the very end of the second column, you will see a drop-down titled Online!
* Here you can pick your internet speed 

Happy Testing :)
