You’re creating your first gem?! 

Where to start? How to start? Publish or not to publish? 

Questions upon questions!  Here are some answers and helpful tips on how to attack and succeed when creating your first gem. 


##  Do your homework

Don’t go into this blind. Take some time - a few hours maybe - reading about gem creation. Here are a few questions to keep in mind while researching:
What is a gem?
Why are gems helpful?
How to create a gem?
How are gems installed?

There are many great resources online to answer these questions.


## Make a plan

Do you think authors write a book without an outline? Or without an idea of what the plot will be? 

Coding is no different! We need an idea and an outline. Before any real coding is done, take some time to write your idea down. What classes do you want? What variables do you need? What methods will you use to get your desired result? 

It’s okay to update your plan

Don’t stress out if things don’t turn out as you planned. This is gem numero uno for you! It is likely that you’ll run into things you didn’t expect or that some methods won’t work out as planned. Heck, you will likely run into issues on your 200th gem. As with everything, be kind to yourself. Unless you are a fortune teller, you can’t plan for the unexpected. Update that plan - and keep on moving! (But don’t go tossing out the entire plan!)
 
 
##  Edit yourself

Hurray! Everything is finally working! Now... go back and break it all to make it pretty. Our first goal is to get everything working. Our second goal is to get everything working and looking cohesive. 

Let’s take it back to our school days. We never submitted the first version of a book report. Our thoughts were scattered, and our grammar and organization were poor. The first draft is always rough. Coding is no different. Take a break and come back ready to make your code better. Keep in mind the rules of D.R.Y -- don’t repeat yourself.


## Check your ego

Don’t be too proud to ask for help. If you’re stuck and can’t get unstuck, reach out to your network and community. I’ve quickly learned that software engineers are thick as thieves. Everyone understands, and everyone is eager to help, share best practices, and give feedback. Make use of it and when someone reaches out to you, continue to pay it forward. 


## Why create and publish gems in the first place? 

Don’t be greedy! Hit the publish button and put your work out into the world for others to use. With the time they saved in building it in the first place -- guess what? -- they will probably improve it, thus paving the way for creativity. This world is a better place because of it. Give and receive -- it’s all good karma. 


## Who is this lady? 

Who am I and why am I so bossy? I’m just like you: I just created and published my first gem. Did I create something groundbreaking? Nope. Everyone starts somewhere. Above is a list of things that made this task less daunting for me. I hope it can do the same for y’all!
