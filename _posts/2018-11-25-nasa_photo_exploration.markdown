I’m very excited to be at the end of FlatIron. For my final project, I decided to work with NASA’s API. Who doesn’t like space?

My application is called NASA photo exploration. Everyday NASA features a photo, and I feature that daily photo on the application’s home screen. I use a bootstrap popover to share additional information about the photo should the user be interested. The application also has a search capability where a user can search for previously featured photos. 

I created an additional feature called explore Mars, which has photos from the Mars Rover. A users can select a camera view and see a wide variety of photos from --- that’s right -- MARS! A user can explore about 800 photos if they like! 

NASA’s API was so much fun to work with. This project wasn’t easy but it sure feels rewarding now that it’s done.
