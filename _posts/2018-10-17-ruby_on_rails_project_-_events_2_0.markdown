My Ruby on Rails project is an application for event listings in Oakland, Calif. It is the same concept as my first Ruby project, but it’s the 2.0 version. 

My project consist of three models: users, events and RSVPs. 

Users
A user can sign up, log in, create and edit their profile. 

Events
A user can create, edit and delete an event posting. Users can view all events created in the application. Events can be filtered by past, today and future. 

RSVPs
Users can RSVP to events. A guest list is available for all events that have RSVPs. All users can see an event’s guest list. 

Styling
I used bootstrap for some basic styling. Flash messages were styled with bootstrap and they are color coded by information, danger, success and alert. 

More to come
This project is still a work in progress. I have additional features that I want to add, including Google Maps for event location and directions, bios and pictures for users, and the ability to connect with friends. Once I add these features, I aim to spice up the website with some neat CSS styling and animations with Javascript.
